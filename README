Incluse is a library to test if a candidate path is
covered/included/accepted by a given policy for inclusion and
exclusion in a hierarchical namespace system.

The most typical application is in filesystems: Your application
operates on files conforming to given rules for which files should be
considered and which should not. Think rsync. Incluse can do the
matching for you.

Incluse supports any combination of simple named nodes, wildcards that
match any single node, and recursive wildcards that non-greedily
matches multiple nodes.

Incluse is extensible in its format support. A sample format is
included for filesystem path policies.
